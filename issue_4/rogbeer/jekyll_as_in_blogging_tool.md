Running the following command on the command line:

jekyll -v

resulted in the following message:

> -bash: /usr/local/bin/jekyll: /usr/bin/ruby2.5: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

After some research, I found that I could run the following command:

/usr/bin/jekyll -v

which resulted in the following message:

> jekyll 3.8.6

I hope this post saves someone else some time.
