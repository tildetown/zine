# current status

we are currently accepting contributions for issue 4! everything very welcome.

# when is a new issue released?

a new issue is released whenever we feel we have enough content.

# how do I get a copy?

every issue should have a `.pdf` in the folder which you can use to print out and make your own version! ~dozens and ~benjaminwil have offered to print and ship the current issue. if you'd like one, just send town mail (if on tilde.town) or reach out to them on [mastodon](http://tiny.tilde.website) and they will do their best to send one out.

~jumblesale, ~insom, and ~joe have also previously sent out versions.
